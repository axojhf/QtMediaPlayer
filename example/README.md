# QtMediaPlayer Demo Application

This simple demo application shows how to integrate QtMediaPlayer into Qt Quick applications.
It demonstrates the basic usage of QtMediaPlayer.
Currently this application is only designed for desktop platforms, but it may get an additional mobile user interface in the future.

This application requires at least **Qt 6.2** to build and run.

All the source code of this application is licensed under **MIT** with some exceptions (please refer to each source file's license header).
However, the image resources are all downloaded from the internet and you should not use them freely. They are all protected by their licenses and what I'm doing here doesn't break them, but I don't have the right to share the licenses with others, so you will have to get a license yourself from the authors if you want to use them in your project. You should use your own material when building your application.
